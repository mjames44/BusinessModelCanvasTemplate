					<h4>Key Partners</h4>
					<p>The most  importantly partner our project depends on, at this
						time, is WordPress. For that reason, it is important to us to
						always stay current with the most popular engines driving web
						design and development.</p>
				</td>
				<td colspan="2">
					<h4>Key Activities</h4>
					<p>
						The key activities of our project will be keeping up with the
						current needs of our customers to proceed the <strong>rich</strong>,
						<strong>robust</strong>, <strong>full featured</strong> WordPress
						sites they need, without the burden of falling behind their
						competition.
					</p>
					<p></p> Also, keeping our training current is vitally important.

				<td colspan="2" rowspan="2">
					<h4>Value Proposition</h4>
					<p>
						Our product provides a <strong>new</strong>, <strong>convenient</strong>,
						<strong>highly usable</strong> interface for the creation and
						customization of WordPress servers.
					<p>
					<p>
						Our customers will experience <strong>faster set up</strong>, <strong>greater
							savings</strong>, without the usual <a class=""
							data-original-title="Overcoming barriers"
							data-content="Our product does the work of a technical support team setting 
							up servers, freeing up teams to focus on growth, 
							expansion, and new ideas."
							data-placement="bottom" rel="popover" href="#">barriers</a> to
						entry.
					<p>
					<p>
						The results will be a <strong>greater opportunity</strong> for our
						users to focus on their <strong>content</strong>, their <strong>customers</strong>,
						and their <strong>design</strong>, instead of learning fast
						changing technologies.
					</p>

						<a class="" data-original-title="Awareness"
							data-content="We raise awareness of

						target are: business fairs, colleges, and training seminars,
						allowing face to face connections between potential customers and
						our project, what it can do for them, and how it can improve the
						way they do business. ⁃ Word of mouth would also be an asset for
						our company. Aesthetics and ease of use of our project are as
						important as any other element. Business owners do not need an
						ugly, clumsy product."

						<a class="" data-original-title="Delivery"
							data-content="Our value proposition is delivered through effective
						service and training. No matter how powerful our product

						larger customer base."

						<a class="" data-original-title="After Sales"

						provide our first line of support. Most support needs arise from a
						lack of familiarity with a product. The easier we make learning to
						use our product, the less we support we will need. After that,

						become an excellent fallback option."
